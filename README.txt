The python files within this directory contain a target-driven BFS algorithm 
to determine the shortests path by distance between two railroad stations 
located in the United States. PIL (python image library) and Tkinter were
employed to visually represent the path traversal after every certain amount
of iterations. Blue marked stations that have been visited, red marks the "open
set" of vertices to be explored, and green marks the shortest path at the end

In order to run RailRoad2.py in the terminal, the user must input the names of two
major US cities in the execution command to designate the starting and ending location.
An example run including Kansas City and Los Angeles would be as follows:
"python RailRoad2.py Kansas City Los Angeles"
